# Python

Several versions of Python are available on Oscar as modules. For Python 2, we recommend using the python/2.7.16 module. For Python 3, we recommend using the python/3.7.4 module. These modules include the `pip` and `virtualenv` commands, but do not include other common Python packages \(e.g., SciPy, NumPy\). This affords individual users complete control over the packages they are using, thereby avoiding issues that can arise when code written in Python requires specific versions of Python packages.

To use the recommend Python modules, use the following commands to load the relevant module:

`module load python/2.7.16`

`module load python/3.7.4`

Users can install any Python package they require by following the instructions given on the [Installing Python Packages](../connecting-to-oscar/oscar/software/installing-software/python-installs.md) page.

## Python in batch jobs

By default, when running in a batch job, `print` in Python is buffered. When running Python in a batch job in SLURM you may see output less often than you would when running interactively. This is because the output is being buffered - the print statements are collected until there is a large amount to print, then the messages are all printed at once. For debugging or checking that a Python script is producing the correct output, you may want to switch off buffering.

For a single python script you can use the `-u` option, e.g.

`python -u my_script.py`

The `-u` stands for "unbuffered". You can use the environment variable `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` to set unbuffered I/O for your whole batch script.

```text
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -n 1

export PYTHONUNBUFFERED=TRUE
python my_script.py
```

There is some performance penalty for having unbuffered print statements, so you may want to reduce the number of print statements, or run buffered for production runs.

Python 2 will enter End-of-Life \(EOL\) status and will receive no further official support as of January 2020. As a consequence, you may see the following message when using pip with Python 2.

`DEPRECATION: Python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 won't be maintained after that date. A future version of pip will drop support for Python 2.7.`

Going forward, the [Python Software Foundation recommends](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) using Python 3 for development.
