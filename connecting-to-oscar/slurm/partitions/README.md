# Partitions

{% hint style="info" %}
The number and size of jobs allowed on Oscar vary with both partition and type of user account. You can email support@ccv.brown.edu if you need advice on which partitions to use
{% endhint %}

The following partitions are available to all Oscar users:

| Name | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| batch | general purpose computing |
| debug | short wait time, short run time partition for debugging |
| gpu | GPU nodes |
| gpu-debug | short wait time, short run time partition for gpu debugging |
| bigmem | large memory nodes |
| smp | older large memory nodes |

{% hint style="info" %}
For current rates and limits see [https://ccv.brown.edu/services/rates/](https://ccv.brown.edu/services/rates/)
{% endhint %}

## batch partition

* General purpose computing
* Priority is determined by account type \(from highest

  to lowest: condo, premium, exploratory\)

Condo limits apply to the group \(i.e., they reflect the sum of all users on the condo\). Condo users can check the limits on their condo with the command `condos`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
There is no limit on the time for condo jobs, but users should be aware that planned maintenance on the machine may occur \(one monthâ€™s notice is given prior to any planned maintenance\).
{% endhint %}

## debug partition

* Short wait time, short run time access for debugging
* All users have the same limits and priority on the debug partition

## gpu partition

* For GPU-based jobs
* Premium users get higher priority and more resources than free users on the GPU partition
* Condo users submit to the gpu partition with normal or priority access \(if they have a priority account in addition to their condo\)

## gpu-debug partition

* Short wait time, short run time gpu access for debugging
* All users have the same limits and priority on the gpu-debug partition

## bigmem

* For jobs requiring large amounts of memory
* Premium users get higher priority and more resources than free users on the bibmem partition
* Condo users submit to the bigmem partition with normal or priority access \(if they have a priority account in addition to their condo\)

## smp partition

* For jobs requiring large amounts of memory
* Premium users get higher priority and more resources than free users on the SMP partition
* Condo users submit to the SMP partition with normal or priority access \(if they have a priority account in addition to their condo\)
