# Account Types

There are four categories of accounts on Oscar.

* exploratory \(free\)  
* premium  
* condo  
* class  

## Exploratory accounts

Exploratory accounts are available to all members of the Brown community for free.

## Premium accounts

Premium accounts are available through a quarterly subscription.

## Condo

PIs who purchase hardware \(compute nodes\) for the CCV machine get a condo account. Condo account users have next-to-run priority on the number of cores equivalent to the hardware they purchased.

{% endhint %}

## Class

Class accounts are provided free of charge for faculty who are teaching using Oscar. To set up accounts for your class, email support@ccv.brown.edu.
